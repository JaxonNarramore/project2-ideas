Review the [Project 2 requirements](https://romebell.gitbook.io/sei-1019/projects/project-2) and check out some [examples](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/seirfx/11-projects/past-projects/project2).

In this space below, list **THREE** ideas for your Project 2. For each idea, include [user stories](https://revelry.co/user-stories-that-dont-suck/) for each idea and a link to the API(s) you want to use for it.

--------------------------------------------------------
1. An app that shows radiation levels in your area to know if you should wear suncreen or not. -NASA API
2. An app that shows when space x is launching a rocket, all the information about the mission and all the information about the rocket that is launching it. -Unoffical spaceX API
3. Click on an image of the sky and get detailed information about a star/nebula/planet in the area you clicked on(dont know if this would be possible but this is my fav idea) - NASA API
4. An app that shows all natural events happening on earth in real time (earthquakes/fires/hurricanes/tornados) - NASA API
5. An app that shows the pollution levels in a neighborhood/city/town/area with real time data. -NASA API
6. An app that has all information on ice cps melting, levels of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere. maybe also add the polution levels in your area into this app(maybe). -NASA API
7. An app that give information on mars(current weather condtions, images from the mars rover, missions involving mars). -NASA API
8. A corona virus app that gives live data on the vrius and other information about the virus(symptoms, how to treat when infected, hospital capacity). -covid19 API
